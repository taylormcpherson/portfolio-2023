          Hi 👋 I&apos;m Taylor,
          <br />
          a frontend software engineer <br />
          with a heart for social impact.
        </h1>
        <p className={textStyles.paragraph}>
          I work at a high-growth startup building responsive, accessible, and
          delightful web and app experiences. I work in React, TypeScript,
          JavaScript, and all things CSS. I regularly use content management
          systems and I enjoy gamifying SEO rankings with platforms like
          Lighthouse, AHrefs, and Google Search Console. This is an
          ever-changing field to work in, and I am always eager to pick up new
          skills, languages, or improvements to my craft.
        </p>
        <p className={textStyles.paragraph}>
          I formally studied computer science, UX research &amp; design, as well
          as feminist theory and art history. Whatever I am doing though, I do
          it with a sincere desire to learn as much as I can and contribute to a
          better world.
